* **It's just Markdown** — write your technical documentation in plain Markdown
  – no need to know HTML, JavaScript, or CSS. 

* **Static, yet searchable** — almost magically, your technical documentation 
  website will be searchable without any further ado. Material for MkDocs comes
  with built-in search – no server needed – that will instantly answer your
  users' queries.
